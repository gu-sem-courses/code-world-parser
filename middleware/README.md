Team Flex - Middleware

In this folder we have the C# code for our middleware system.


# Client Folder
The C# file named Program.cs contains the client side of the middleware software.
TrialClient.csproj file details which dependiencies the software uses.
The bin and obj folders are autogenerated as of compiling and running the Program.

# protos Folder
The trial.proto file works as a form of blueprint/interface provider for what services and messages the server and client side can use. A script is needed to be run every time the proto files are changed.

# Server Folder
The C# file named Program.cs contains the server side of the middleware software.
TrialServer.csproj file details which dependiencies the software uses.
The bin and obj folders are autogenerated as of compiling and running the Program.

# Services Folder
Trial.cs and TrialGrpc.cs file in here are autogenerated and are dependent on the protos file.
These files deals with the heavy lifiting of the middleware.
Trial.csproj file details which dependiencies the software uses.

# generate_protos.bas
This script file contains the neccesary WINDOWS script to auto-generate the CS files in the Service folder. This script uses the proto file in the protos folder and needs to be run when ever you update the trial.protos file.
