DIT355 H18 Mini Project: Distributed Systems Development

Team Flex - Middleware

In this folder we have the C# code for our Piping-Middleware and GitGetter-Filter system .

# protos Folder
The trial.proto file works as a form of blueprint/interface provider for what services and messages the server and client side can use. A script is needed to be run every time the proto files are changed.

# Pipes Folder
The C# project and namespace called pipes contains the src code for the UnityNode, GetterNode and ParsingNode software.
The bin and obj folders are autogenerated as of compiling and running the Program.
The correct .exe file is located in bin/Debug, and not in SecondNode/bin/Debug.
A copy of the .exe file in here gets transported into the Vis unity project after it has been built.

# Services Folder
Trial.cs and TrialGrpc.cs file in here are autogenerated and are dependent on the protos file. These files deals with the heavy lifiting of the middleware.

# generate_protos.bas
This script file contains the neccesary WINDOWS script to auto-generate the CS files in the Service folder. This script uses the proto file in the protos folder and needs to be run when ever you update the trial.protos file.

# How to Setup once Pulled for the First time
General Setup For Windows
1. You will need to setup all the projects using Visual Studio 2017, but you only need to setup Services if you are rebuilding it, you open it empty and under File/New there is a option called "Project From Exsisting Code...", pick that, make sure its a C# projects, then after select the projects outmoste folder.

2. The "include subfolder" option must be checked, the name must be the same and depeding on the project it's either a console application or a Class Library. All projects but Services are Console Application, while the Services is a Class Library.

3. The framework of all the projects except Services need to be set to 4.6. Services need to be set to 4.5. Dont forget to check the Auto-generate binding redirects option.

4. Once you have done that you need to set up all the dependenices, using nuget packet manager. How you setup Services will be handeled in step 6.

Nuget Dependecies by Project
Pipes - NewtonSoft.Json, Grpc, Grpc.core, System.Interactive.Async, System.Net.Http, System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms,Encoding, Primitives

Services - Grpc, Grpc.core, Grpc.tools, Google.Protobuf System.Interactive.Async,

GitGetter - NewtonSoft.Json, System.Net.Http, System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms,Encoding, Primitives

6. How to add Services Reference to Pipies project.
On the References of the projects right click and select Add References... then Browse to the Services/bin/Debug folder and select the Services.dll file, then check in the slection after browsing. That should do it.
